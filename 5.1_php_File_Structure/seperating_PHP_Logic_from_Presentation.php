?? How to Organize your folders and files?

Try and organize your files on the structure of MVC i.e. Model View Controller where:

Folder "model" : comprises of all files that include all the data that will be passed on to functions to get displayed.

Folder "view" : Includes files related to display i.e. all the HTML structure and echo, and print_r() statements.

Folder "contoller": Includes all the files containing logical expressions and functions.

?? the files in these seperate folders would be knowing about each other but there would not be any displaying statements in "control" OR any logical expressions in "view". As an exception, There could be map() or other related looping functions in "view" since they are very commonly used for displaying data.
